\subsection{Hardness of DirectedBandwidth over Oriented Graphs}
\label{subsec:hardness-of-directedbandwidth}

In this section we consider the hardness of \textsc{DirectedBandwidth} over oriented graphs.
%
With respect to the \textsc{Bandwidth} problem the following result of Dubey, Feige, and Unger is of interest.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{JCSS:DFU11}]
    It is $\NP$-hard to approximate \textsc{Bandwidth} within a ratio of $c$, for any constant $c > 0$.
\end{theorem}

We provide the same result for \textsc{DirectedBandwidth} over oriented graphs.

\begin{theorem}
    It is $\NP$-hard to approximate \textsc{DirectedBandwidth} over oriented graphs within a ratio of $c$, for any constant $c > 0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to show how to approximate \textsc{Bandwidth} within a constant, assuming we can approximate \textsc{DirectedBandwidth} over any oriented graph.
    %
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a simple connected graph with bandwidth $b$.
    %
    We define an oriented graph $G' = (V \cup V', E')$, where $V' = \{u' : u \in V \}$ and $E'=\{uu' : u \in V \} \cup \{ u'v : uv \in E \}$.
    %
    We call each $u \in V$ the parent of $u'$, $V$ the parent nodes and $V'$ the
    child nodes.
    %
    Note that since $G$ is undirected, for each $uv \in E$, both $u'v$ and $v'u$
    are in $E'$.
    %
    We claim that the bandwidth of $G$ at most twice the bandwidth of $G'$.

    We first observe that the bandwidth of $G'$ is at most $b$.
    %
    Indeed, let $\pi = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n)$ be a permutation of $V$ with
    bandwidth $b$ in $G$.
    %
    We construct a permutation $\pi'$ of $V\cup V'$ with bandwidth $b$ in $G'$.
    %
    Set $q = \lfloor n / b \rfloor$ and $r = n \mod b$.
    %
    For $k = 0, 1, \dots, q - 1$, let
    %
    \[ \sigma_k = (u'_{qb + 1}, \dots, u'_{qb + b}, u_{qb + 1}, \dots, u_{qb + b}) ~~\text{and}~~ \pi' = \sigma_0 \cdots \sigma_q, \]
    %
    where $\sigma_q = (u'_{qb + 1}, \dots, u'_{qb + r}, u_{qb + 1}, \dots, u_{qb + r})$.
    %
    To verify that $\DBW(\pi', G') \le b$, consider any edge $uv \in E$; edge $uu'$ has length either $b$ or $r < b$ and edge $u'v$ is either a forward
    edge or has the same length as $uv$ under $\pi$.

    Now let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $V\cup V'$ with bandwidth $b'$.
    %
    We can construct a permutation $\pi$ for $V$ by simply removing the child nodes.
    %
    The bandwidth of $\pi$ is at most $2b'$.
    %
    It follows that if $b'\le c b$, then we obtain a permutation of $V$ with bandwidth $2c b$.
    %
    In other words, if we can approximate \textsc{DirectedBandwidth} within ratio $c$, then we can approximate \textsc{Bandwidth} within ratio $2c$.
\end{proof}

In a long line of research on understanding order fairness in the state machine replica (SMR) problem, Schneider \cite{CSUR:Schneider90} first proposes \emph{order} --- ``Every non-faulty state machine replica processes the requests it receives in the same relative order'' --- as the third property (other than consistency and liveness) that an ideal BFT SMR protocol should satisfy.
%
This is later formalized by Garay and Kiayias \cite{RSA:GarKia20} as ``serializability'' in ledger consensus.
%
Serializability requires that if \tx enters all honest parties' mempool before $\tx'$, honest parties should reject the order $\tx', \tx$ (in their settled ledger).

We provide an overview of all existing works on defining order fairness and implementing fair-order protocols.
%
Roughly speaking, we classify them into three directions --- (i) blind-order-fairness, which orders transactions while hiding their content; (ii) block-order-fairness, solving the Condorcet paradox by claiming ``blocks''; and (iii) timed-order-fairness, defining a time-based fair-order without cyclic preferences.
%
We highlight that, compared with our contributions, none of these existing fair order notions provides bounded unfairness --- i.e., there is no bound in the definition on how ``unfairly'' a transaction could be put before another.

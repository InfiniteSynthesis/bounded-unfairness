\section{Preliminaries} \label{sec:preliminaries}

In this section we first briefly describe our protocol execution model, transaction diffusion mechanism and the dynamic environment.
%
Refer to \cref{sec:preliminaries-contd} for more details.
%
We then introduce transaction profiles and dependency graphs in \cref{subsec:transaction-profiles-dependency-graphs}.
%
They are notations crucial to the discussion of order fairness.

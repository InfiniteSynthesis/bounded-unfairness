\section{Order Fairness}
\label{sec:order-fairness}

In this section we first give a definition of order fairness in the sense of  bounded unfairness.
%
We then connect order fairness to \textsc{DirectedBandwidth} and provide a fine-grained fair-order definition which is the best that one can expect in this setting.
%
Next, we study this problem in the context of state machine replication and permissionless participation respectively.

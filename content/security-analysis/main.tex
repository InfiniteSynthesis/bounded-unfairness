\section{Security Analysis}
\label{sec:security-analysis}

In this section we provide a security analysis of the \Taxis protocol.
%
We show that, in a $(\gamma, s)$-respecting environment, when appropriately parameterized, the ledger \ledger in \Taxis satisfies three security properties---consistency, liveness and order fairness.

The first two properties have been introduced in \cref{subsec:protocol-execution-model}; regarding the order fairness property, it requires that the protocol implements $(\varphi, \TDBW)$-fair-order serialization --- i.e., in the settled part of the final ledger, all the transactions will follow the order defined by \cref{def:varphi-tdbw-order-fairness}.
